This is a fork of scrypt from http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html.
This fork is for building scrypt on Windows using Visual Studio 2008
(without MinGW)

Summary of changes in scrypt 1.1.6:

- Use proxy header files for those not available on Windows:
  inttypes.h & stdint.h (from http://code.google.com/p/msinttypes/)
  unistd.h (from http://stackoverflow.com/a/826027)

- Additionally borrow gettimeofday() and getopt() functionality from
  PostgreSQL and freegetopt (http://freegetopt.sourceforge.net/)
  respectively

- Modify getsalt(), memlimit_rlimit(), and tarsnap_readpass() for
  Windows

- Include minor changes in fprintf() format specification for Windows

- Borrow pre-generated config.h from py-scrypt source
  (https://bitbucket.org/mhallin/py-scrypt/src)

- Use ninja (http://martine.github.io/ninja/) to build scrypt.exe,
  include hand-written build.ninja file (naive attempt)



To build on Windows with Visual Studio 2008 Express Edition installed:

- Install OpenSSL binaries (may be from here:
  http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)

- Install ninja if required (zip contains single ninja.exe binary:
  https://github.com/martine/ninja/releases/download/v1.4.0/ninja-win.zip)

- If required, modify 'build.ninja' in (scrypt-1.1.6 directory) based
  on the OpenSSL install directory

- Run vsvars32.bat found in %VS90COMNTOOLS% directory

- Manually create 'build' directory under scrypt-1.1.6

- Run 'ninja -v'

scrypt.exe should be created in the 'build' directory.
